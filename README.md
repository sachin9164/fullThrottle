## Employee Time Report

- For **styling** i have used materialize CSS .
- To fetch **data** i had created mock API using https://mockapi.io/ and stored all the given JSON in that API.
- For calendar i have added react-calendar-timeline as dependency.

###### Description

I tried to keep code simple , i created three components

- UserData -Fetched data by calling API to get data and passed as props
- Modal - Implemented using materialize
- Calendar - Finally I formated the data as per Calendar UI and inserted in Calendar UI object to get start time and end time inside calendar.

**Note** : Calendar UI is little tricky by default it will be there in present date to view active hours please scroll the calendar .

If your facing difficulty go through the below npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar-timeline
